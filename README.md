## Main packages used
* Production: Express, Apollo, React & React-DOM, Styled-components
* Development: Faker, Webpack

## Completion
### Technologies to use
* [x] Typescript (or Javascript)
  > Typescript on the front, ES2017 on the back
* [x] Node
  > Node 8 LTS
* [x] React
  > Latest release: 16.7.0

### Requirements
* [/] Handles 100,000s of rows.
  > Not full handled, a virtualization must be added as well as a worker for sorting in order to avoid main thread lock. In this repo, I've sliced the list to 1k items.
* [x] Auto-sizes columns based on cell content.
* [x] Generic, re-usable API that abstracts away the underlying implementation.
  > Achieved via Apollo
* [x] Light backend that serves up the data.
  > Achieved via Express & Apollo
* [x] Allow sorting by clicking on columns.
* [x] No 3rd party data grid library.

## Stretch
* [ ] Resizable / draggable columns.
* [ ] Edit cell content.
* [ ] Ability to delete rows.
